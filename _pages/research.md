My name is Sean Vittadello, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Systems Biology at The University of Melbourne, Australia. I employ mathematics to improve understanding of biological systems, taking a rigorous and robust approach from the viewpoint of pure mathematics. I enjoy using mathematics from both analytical and algebraic areas to help solve problems, also creating new mathematics along the way.

Research interests
====
General areas of interest include:
- Systems biology
- Algebraic biology
- Mathematical biology
- Pure mathematics
- Applied mathematics

Specific biologically-related interests include:
- Developmental patterning processes, such as Turing patterns and positional information
- Comparison of models for biological systems
- Cell migration, cell proliferation, and more generally the cell cycle, particularly in relation to cancer cells
- Heterogeneity of cancer-cell populations

Mathematical areas employed include:
- Ordinary, partial, and delay differential equations
- Algebraic topology, particularly simplicial complexes, homology, and homotopy
- Group theory, including group actions on simplicial complexes
- Complex analysis
- Functional analysis

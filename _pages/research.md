I study biological systems using both algebraic and analytical methods from mathematics. General areas of interest include:
- Systems biology
- Algebraic biology
- Mathematical biology
- Pure mathematics
- Applied mathematics

Specific biologically-related interests include:
- Developmental patterning processes, particularly Turing patterns and positional information
- Comparison of mathematical models for biological systems
- Design principles of biological systems
- Cell migration, cell proliferation, and more generally the cell cycle, particularly in relation to cancer cells
- Heterogeneity of cancer-cell populations
- The interaction of cell behaviour, including migration, proliferation, and differentiation, with environments that have complex 3-D geometries

Mathematical areas applied so far include:
- Ordinary, partial, and delay differential equations
- Algebraic topology
- Group theory
- Complex analysis
- Functional analysis
- Combinatorics
- Topology

I am interested in complex biological systems, particularly at the level at which life emerges in a living organism. I use both algebraic and analytical techniques from mathematics to develop general mathematical frameworks for studying biological systems.

Biological and mathematical interests include:
- Frameworks for the comparison of mathematical models of biological systems.
- Automating the search for design principles underlying biological systems (for example, developmental patterning processes such as Turing patterns and positional information), with application to synthetic biological systems.
- Unifying biological knowledge of complex biological systems.
- Formulating a mathematical definition of (weak) emergence.
- Formulating a mathematical definition of the emergent phenomenon of life.
- The interaction of cell behaviour, including migration, proliferation, and differentiation, with environments that have complex 3-D geometries.

Mathematical areas of interest include:
- Combinatorics (hypergraphs)
- Group theory
- Algebraic topology (simplicial complexes, persistent homology)
- Complex analysis
- Functional analysis ($C^{\\ast}$-algebras)
- Topology
- Differential geometry/topology
- Ordinary, partial, and delay differential equations

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Theoretical Systems Biology]([https://www.theosysbio.com/](https://www.theosysbio.com/people/sean-vittadello)) within [Melbourne Integrative Genomics](https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia.

In my research I develop and apply mathematics to improve understanding of complex biological systems, taking a rigorous and robust approach from the perspective of pure mathematics. I enjoy using a broad range of mathematics in my research of biological systems, also creating new mathematics along the way.

I hold a Ph.D. in pure mathematics from [The University of Newcastle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/), Australia, and a Ph.D. in mathematical biology from [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/), Australia.

Initially I worked solely in pure mathematics, in the area of $C^{\\ast}$-algebras, and my interests later broadened to include the application of mathematics to understanding biological systems. My work therefore appears in both applied and pure mathematics journals.

My name is Sean Vittadello, and I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Systems Biology at The University of Melbourne, Australia. I employ mathematics to improve understanding of biological systems, taking a rigorous and robust approach from the viewpoint of pure mathematics. I enjoy using all available mathematics from both analytical and algebraic areas to help solve problems, also creating new mathematics along the way.

Research interests
====
General areas of interest include:
1. Systems biology.
2. Algebraic biology.
3. Mathematical biology.
4. Pure mathematics.
5. Applied mathematics.

Specific biologically-related interests include:
1. Cell migration, cell proliferation, and more generally the cell cycle, particularly in relation to solid cancers.
2. Developmental patterning processes, such as Turing patterns and positional information.
3. Comparison of models for biological systems.

Mathematical areas employed include:
1. Ordinary, partial, and delay differential equations.
2. Algebraic topology, particularly simplicial complexes and homology.
3. Group theory.
4. Complex analysis.
5. Functional analysis.

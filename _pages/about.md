I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Theoretical Systems Biology](https://www.theosysbio.com/) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. I employ mathematics to improve understanding of biological systems, taking a rigorous and robust approach from the viewpoint of pure mathematics. I enjoy using mathematics from both analytical and algebraic areas to help solve problems, also creating new mathematics along the way.

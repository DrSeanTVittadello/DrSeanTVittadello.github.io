I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Theoretical Systems Biology](https://www.theosysbio.com/) within [Melbourne Integrative Genomics](https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia. I employ mathematics to improve understanding of complex biological systems, taking a rigorous and robust approach from the perspective of pure mathematics. I enjoy using a broad range of mathematics in my research of biological systems, also creating new mathematics along the way. I hold a Ph.D. in pure mathematics from [The University of Newcastle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/), Australia, and a Ph.D. in mathematical biology from [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/), Australia.

I started life as a pure mathematician, working in the area of $C^{\\ast}$-algebras, and later developed interest in the application of mathematics to understanding complex biological systems. My work therefore appears in both pure and applied mathematics journals.
